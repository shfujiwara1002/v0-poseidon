# Poseidon.AI v0 Screen Prompts — Architecture B Edition

> **Architecture B: v0 Foundation + Poseidon Expression Layer**
>
> Aligned with `CLAUDE.md`. Each prompt generates shadcn/ui-native output.
> v0 output is placed directly in `src/pages/` with minimal adaptation only (see Poseidon化 Rules below).
>
> **Workflow**: v0.dev → paste prompt → v0 PR → merge → minimal adaptation (import fix + GovernFooter) → route connection

## v0 Custom Instructions (paste into v0.dev settings)

```
## Design System Rules (Architecture B — 2-layer CSS)

### Theme & Colors
- Dark theme ONLY. Background: #0B1221 (deep navy). Never use white/light backgrounds.
- Surface: #0F1D32. Card: #132237. Accent overlay: rgba(255,255,255,0.05).
- Engine accent colors (use CSS variables in comments for post-v0 mapping):
  - Dashboard: cyan #00F0FF (→ var(--engine-dashboard))
  - Protect: teal #14B8A6 (→ var(--engine-protect))
  - Grow: violet #8B5CF6 (→ var(--engine-grow))
  - Execute: amber #EAB308 (→ var(--engine-execute))
  - Govern: blue #3B82F6 (→ var(--engine-govern))
- Text: primary #F1F5F9, secondary #CBD5E1, muted #64748B
- Status: success #10B981, warning #F59E0B, error #EF4444, info #38BDF8

### Card Component
- Use glass-morphism: backdrop-blur-xl bg-white/5 border border-white/10 rounded-2xl
- Padding: p-4 md:p-6. Shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.2).
- Engine-colored cards: add left border-2 with engine color (border-l-2 border-[#14B8A6])

### Typography
- Font: Inter (headers bold 600, body normal 400, mono JetBrains Mono)
- Scale: display 36px, h1 30px, h2 24px, h3 20px, body 16px, caption 12px
- Headings: text-white font-semibold. Body: text-slate-300.

### Layout
- Mobile-first responsive with md: breakpoints. Max-width: 1280px centered.
- Spacing: 4px base unit. Section gaps: gap-4 md:gap-6.
- Two-column engine pages: 2/3 primary feed (left) + 1/3 decision rail (right), stack on mobile.

### Components & Patterns
- Use shadcn/ui primitives: Button, Badge, Tabs, Card, Table, ScrollArea, Separator, Input
- Icons: Always wrap in colored circle (bg-{color}/10 rounded-full p-2). Use lucide-react.
- Animation: framer-motion stagger children 0.08s delay. FadeUp (y:20→0, opacity:0→1).
- Charts: Recharts with dark theme (grid #253852, tick #6B7280, tooltip bg #0F1D32)

### Governance Pattern (CRITICAL — add to EVERY screen)
- Every screen MUST end with a governance footer bar:
  Full-width bg-white/3 border-t border-white/10 p-3 with:
  - Shield icon + "Verified" badge (green)
  - Audit ID in monospace (e.g. "GV-2026-0215-DASH")
  - "Request human review" ghost button
- Add evidence rows ("ProofLine") under key data sections:
  Small muted row: "Claim | Evidence | Source | Basis" format

## Key Domain Component Names (for v0 prompt reference)
- ScoreRing: Circular progress indicator
- CategoryScoreBar: Horizontal bar breakdown
- ContributionChart: Bar chart with target line
- MilestonesTimeline: Vertical timeline
- ForecastBandChart: SVG forecast with confidence bands
- SHAPWaterfallChart: Feature importance waterfall
- ActionQueueCard: Approve/decline/defer card
- Sparkline: Compact trend line
- ProofLine: Evidence row (claim, evidence, source, basis)
- GovernFooter: Governance footer bar (audit ID, model version)
```

---

## Poseidon化 Rules (v0 → Production)

v0 output のレイアウト・コンテンツは変更しない。以下の最小適応のみ行う。

### Required:

```
1. IMPORT FIX     "use client" 削除, next/image → <img>, next/link → router <Link to=...>
2. PATH FIX       @/components/ui/* のパスがプロジェクト構造と一致するか確認
3. LAYER 1 CHECK  shadcn/ui クラスが正常動作するか確認 (dark theme, CSS vars)
4. GOVERN FOOTER  Tier 1-2 ページに <GovernFooter /> を追加 (未存在の場合のみ)
5. MOBILE         375px レイアウト確認、タッチターゲット ≥44px
```

### Prohibited:

- **旧コンポーネントの追加禁止** — ScoreRing, NetWorthHero, RiskScoreDial, GlassCard, EngineBadge 等を v0 ページに import しない
- **PageShell でラップ禁止** — v0 ページは自己完結型
- **旧コンテキストプロバイダーへの依存追加禁止** — useEngineTheme, getEngineToken 等を使わない
- **glass/neon/engine デコレーションの追加禁止** — v0 出力に含まれていない場合

### File placement:

- **v0 ページ** → `src/pages/{ScreenName}.tsx` (自己完結型コンポーネント)
- **v0 プリミティブ** → `src/components/ui/` (shadcn/ui)

---

## Screen Inventory (aligned with MIT Demo Content Strategy)

### Tier 1: Golden Path (HIGH priority — must be flawless)
