# Poseidon — Presentation Script

> Target duration: 4–5 minutes | MIT CTO Program | Group 7 | March 2026

## Slide 01 — Title

Good afternoon, everyone. We are Group 7, and today we are presenting **Poseidon** — the trusted AI-native money platform.

Poseidon is built on four engines: Protect, Grow, Execute, and Govern. Together, they form a single auditable system that manages personal finances with AI that computes, explains, and waits for human approval before taking any action.

## Slide 02 — The Coordination Gap

Let's start with the problem.

The average American uses over five financial apps. None of them talk to each other. The result is a hidden coordination tax — $133 per month per user in wasted subscriptions, overdraft fees, and missed optimization.

Fraud losses alone account for $12.5 billion a year. Overdraft fees add another $12 billion.

Mint proved that visibility is not enough. It shut down in 2024. The lesson is clear: showing data does not coordinate action. **You** — the user — are still the integration layer.

Fintech solved visibility. What can we solve next?

## Slide 03 — Why Now: Environmental Shift

Three forces are converging right now.

First, **open banking APIs** are becoming standardized across the EU, UK, US, and Japan. Regulations like PSD2 and GDPR are creating the legal infrastructure for secure data sharing.

Second, **AI and ML technology** has matured dramatically. Inference costs are dropping, and multi-agent systems can now coordinate complex workflows.

Third, **consumer expectations** have shifted. A new generation expects proactive, AI-native services — not just dashboards. They want guidance and automated action.

2025 is the window for AI-native financial services, and that is exactly where Poseidon sits.

## Slide 04 — Solution: 4 Engines

Our architecture is a closed loop of four engines.

**Protect** detects threats in under 100 milliseconds, generates explainable risk factors with confidence scores, and creates a Govern-verified audit trail.

**Grow** forecasts your financial trajectory with confidence bands, tracks savings goals, and routes portfolio recommendations to Execute.

**Execute** manages a prioritized action queue. Every action requires consent-first approval and is automatically logged in the Govern audit trail.

**Govern** sits underneath all three. It blocks risky AI decisions before they reach the customer, shows why each decision was made, and creates audit-ready records for compliance.

This is governance by design — not governance as an afterthought.

## Slide 05 — Beyond Aggregation

How do we differentiate from existing fintech?

We match every baseline feature: data aggregation, budgeting tools, and basic insights. But we go further on five critical capabilities.

AI-powered insights are built in by design, not bolted on. Regulatory compliance is governed by design. We offer personalized ML-driven predictions and recommendations, natural language explanations powered by low-temperature models with contribution factors, and consent-first automation with full auditability.

That governance moat is extremely difficult to replicate.

## Slide 06 — Compliance-First Roadmap

Execution is phased across four stages, each with hard gates.

**Phase 1** — the first three months — focuses on the compliance foundation: bank-grade protocols, SOC2, privacy-by-design, AI ethics board, LLMOps, and initial Protect and Grow pilots.

**Phase 2** builds the execution engine with proof-of-concept workflows and a precision target of 70%.

**Phase 3** proves reliability at scale — 277,000 users, 80% precision, and 99.9% uptime — achieving operating break-even.

**Phase 4** scales further: 500K users, 90% precision, and expanded data coverage.

We do not move to the next phase until every gate is met.

## Slide 07 — Unit Economics

The unit economics are strong.

Customer lifetime value exceeds acquisition cost by 17x on the Plus tier, with blended acquisition cost under $10, driven by organic-first growth. Gross margin reaches 87% at scale — in line with typical SaaS benchmarks.

Our pricing is straightforward: Free for dashboard and basic Protect, $7.99 per month for Plus with full Protect, Grow, and Execute, and $19.99 per month for Pro with full capability.

We reach operating breakeven at Month 12 on $25 million total capital. Series A is triggered at $300K monthly revenue in Month 9.

---

## Slide 08 — Summary: Three Strategic Pillars

Our strategy rests on three pillars.

**First, bank-grade governance.** Regulatory compliance, operationalized ML and LLMOps, and every AI action is reversible and auditable by design.

**Second, an AI-powered personal financial assistant.** Deterministic models compute. Generative AI explains. Humans approve.

**Third, a sustainable business model.** Users save roughly $640 per year. At $96 per year for Plus, that is approximately a 7x value-to-cost ratio. Gross margin is 87%. Break-even at Month 11. Payback at Month 16.

Our vision: **establish the trusted financial platform where AI coordination serves human financial wellbeing.**

## Slide 09 — Epilogue: One Year Reflection

Looking back, this year has been tough — and totally worth it.

We built a financial guardian that computes, explains, and waits for your approval. That is the operating principle behind everything Poseidon does.

Thank you. We welcome your questions.

## Slide 10 — Appendix (if asked)

The appendix contains detailed assumptions behind adoption curves, risk controls, and operating thresholds. These are designed so any diligence team can replicate our model transparently.

## Slide 11 — Business Model Detail (if asked)

Diving deeper into the business model: customer lifetime return is 10x on Plus and 51x on Pro. For every dollar of revenue, 73 to 89 cents is profit after all AI and infrastructure costs.

The total addressable market for personal finance plus AI advisory is $7 billion. Our target segment — AI-native money management — is $1.5 billion. We conservatively project $25 million in 3-year capture at just 1.2% penetration.

By Month 36 we project 2.2 million monthly active users, 717,000 paying, and $96 million in annual revenue at 56% operating margin. Growth rates decay from 12% to 2.4% monthly, benchmarked against Copilot and Rocket Money trajectories.
